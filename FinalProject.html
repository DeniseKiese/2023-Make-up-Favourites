          <br />
          An easy-to-use loose powder, perfectly curated for all skin tones to
          create an airbrushed, long-lasting complexion while blurring the

          <br />
          What is does:
          <br />
          The Huda Beauty Easy Bake Loose Powders are inspired by Huda's strong
          belief hat the technique of baking is a key step to a flawless finish
          while ensuring long-lasting, meltproof makeup.

          <br />

          Easy Bake is easy to use due to its unique powder net which disperses
          a controlled amount of powder, and by following Huda's step-by-step
          guide, within a few minutes you'll brighten and revitalize your under
          eye while enhancing the contours of your face.

          <br />

          This extremely light and silky texture blends seamlessly into the skin
          leaving it matte with a hint of sheen, for a luminous finish that
          controls shine throughout the day.

          Your favourite filter in a bottle is back (and its better than ever).
          Huda Beautys #FauxFilter Luminous Matte Foundation has all the
          credentials you fell for the first time, but now with a fragrance-free
          formula, 24-hour wear and a matte (but not flat!) finish.
          <br />
          Providing full, flexible coverage (theres no risk of creasing or
          caking), the true filter lends a smooth, real-skin effect as it blurs
          the appearance of pores and conceals anything you may wish to conceal
          from breakouts to broken capillaries, this base means serious business
          with its innovative, matte-yet-luminous texture that cuts shine
          without compromising your natural glow (Hello, lit-from-within!). And,
          because of the long-wearing, non-drying, non-comedogenic formula, this
          wont clog your pores and feels virtually weightless and it wont smudge
          or transfer, whatever the day (or the weather) throws at you.
          Waterproof, sweat-proof, humidity-proof, party-proof, pool-proof and
          mask-proof, this was made to withstand your demands and it comes in a
          spectrum of shades to suit every complexion.
